**Neon Memory Cards** is a prototype of web application designed to accelerate language learning by leveraging the power of interactive flashcards. This prototype app offers a dynamic and efficient way to learn new vocabulary and phrases across various languages, making it an indispensable tool for language enthusiasts and polyglots alike.

## Description

With **Neon Memory Cards**, users can create an unlimited number of custom folders, each tailored to specific topics or languages, facilitating organized and focused learning. The heart of the app lies in its dual-sided cards, featuring a built-in editor that allows learners to jot down new and challenging words along with their translations, courtesy of a seamless integration with a translation API.
